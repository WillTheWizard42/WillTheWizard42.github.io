#### The game

This is a multiplayer game, played by 2 to 6 players depending on the map and settings. Each player starts with one blob in a corner of the map, on their turn, a player can choose to duplicate a blob to a neighbouring tile, or to jump a blob two tiles away. In the case of a jump, the starting tile is left empty after the player's turn. In either case, the target tile must be empty. On arriving to a new tile, all blobs not of the player's colour in a tile neighbouring the target will change to the player's colour. If a player cannot make such a move, their turn is skipped.

The game stops when no player can move, or when all players but one are completely eliminated. The winner is the player with the most blobs.
