#### Context

As I learned more about making games, I read about game engines and decided to try Unity. <br />
This is the first game I made in Unity, and it helped me learn many things, like C#, Quaternions, and Unity itself.

#### The game

The player controls a ball, and must not fall through the floor. As the player rolls over blocks, they will turn red and fall after a short delay. New blocks (or holes) are generated as the player approaches the edge, the floor is always tilting to a random angle to make things more challenging.

Use **w-a-s-d** to move and spacebar to jump.

This was more of a learning experience for me rather than trying to make a full game, so the graphics are very basic geometric shapes and there are no sounds. I could definitely improve those two aspects a lot.
