#### Context

When I first started coding, I was advised to start by learning Python, as it was easy to get into. <br />
Very fast, I decided to make a game with a few of my friends, and this is what we made.
	
#### The game

As the player, you control a Zeppelin and must drop bombs on the canons shooting at you. Succesfully destroying all the canons will let you proceed to the next level. Some levels have a boss canon which is stronger and harder to destroy, and levels get progressively harder.

The game ends when the player runs out of health, the goal is to get the highest possible score before that happens.

Use **w-a-s-d** to move and spacebar to drop bombs.

The music is Hell March 2 from Red Alert 2.
